# Development version

* Fix use with `echarts4r`. Using `add_prompt()` made plots very narrow (#5).

* Add documentation on how to add a tooltip on a single icon, and how to have 
  line breaks in the text.

  - New `size` value `"fit"` that makes the tooltip be as large as the element
    to which it is attached.
  - The default font size is slightly smaller (`1rem`).
